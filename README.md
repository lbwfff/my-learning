In 2021, I started to get in touch with bioinformatics. This project was used by me to record various codes I wrote during my learning process, including the use of bioinformatics software on the Linux command line, including R language codes, including R language-based Python-based machine learning, and all kinds of messy things. The vast majority of annotations are written in Chinese.

This project is equivalent to my notebook. When I want to use the code I have written, I can find it in this project and repeat it easily (but then there are more and more codes. I want to find a certain line of code in my memory. also become more difficult).
