Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality and fMRI. Using virtual reality, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single FOV to a city street. We used individualized, within-subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately posterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these posterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these posterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the posterior edge of high-level visual cortex.\\n正确文本：To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context).

However, motion is another cue that could be used by the visual system to classify objects. To determine how motion-defined object category information is processed by the brain in the absence of luminance-defined form information, we created a novel stimulus set of “object kinematograms” to isolate motion-defined signals from other sources of visual information. Object kinematograms were generated by extracting motion information from videos of 6 object categories and applying the motion to limited-lifetime random dot patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 15, 40% women), we investigated whether category information from the object kinematograms could be decoded within the occipitotemporal and parietal cortex and evaluated whether the information overlapped with category responses to static images from the original videos. We decoded object category for both stimulus formats in all higher-order regions of interest (ROIs). More posterior occipitotemporal and ventral regions showed higher accuracy in the dynamic condition, while more anterior occipitotemporal and dorsal regions showed higher accuracy in the static condition. Further, decoding across the two stimulus formats was possible in all regions. These results demonstrate that motion cues can elicit widespread and robust category responses on par with those elicited by dynamic luminance cues, even in ventral regions of visual cortex that have traditionally been associated with primarily image-defined form processing.\\n正确文本：Humans can label and categorize objects in a visual scene with high accuracy and speed, a capacity well characterized with studies using static images.

Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity.

Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most suppressed by cognitive demand, but not with voxels activated by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the frequency of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their variety or duration. An additional moderating role of the frequency of nonphysical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.\\n正确文本：Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging.

Here, we show that in male and female mice, silencing cortico-thalamic feedback profoundly reduces state-dependent differences in the response of dLGN neurons to visual stimuli. This holds true for dLGN responses to both temporal and spatial features of the visual stimulus. These results reveal that the state-dependent shift of the response to visual stimuli in an early stage of visual processing depends on cortico-thalamic feedback.'}, {'text': '错误文本：Human vision processes light and dark stimuli in visual scenes with separate ON and OFF neuronal pathways. In nature, stimuli lighter or darker than their local surround have different spatial properties and contrast distributions (Ratliff et al., 2010; Cooper and Norcia, 2015; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021). Similarly, in human vision, we show that luminance contrast affects the perception of lights and darks differently. At low contrast, human subjects of both sexes locate dark stimuli faster and more accurately than light stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the OFF pathway. However, at high contrast, they locate light stimuli faster and more accurately than dark stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the ON pathway. Luminance contrast was strongly correlated with multiple ON/OFF dominance ratios estimated from light/dark ratios of performance errors, missed targets, or reaction times (RTs). All correlations could be demonstrated at multiple eccentricities of the central visual field with an ON-OFF perimetry test implemented in a head-mounted visual display. We conclude that low-contrast stimuli are processed faster and more accurately by OFF pathways than ON pathways. However, the OFF dominance shifts toward ON dominance when stimulus contrast increases, as expected from the lower-contrast sensitivity of ON cortical pathways (Kremkow et al., 2014; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021). The results highlight the importance of contrast polarity in visual field measurements and predict a loss of low-contrast vision in humans with OFF pathway deficits, as demonstrated in animal models (Sarnaik et al., 2014).\\n正确文本：Human vision processes light and dark stimuli in visual scenes with separate ON and OFF neuronal pathways.

Periodicity was observed in two distinct frequency bands: First, word-locked saccades at 4-5 Hz display coherence with occipital theta-band activity. Second, fixation durations fluctuate rhythmically at ∼1 Hz, in coherence with whole-head delta-band activity. This latter effect was additionally phase-locked to sentence endings, suggesting a relationship with the formation of multi-word chunks.

Here we show that plexinA1 (PlexA1) and plexinA3 (PlexA3) receptors are expressed by CS neurons, whereas their ligands, semaphorin-5A (Sema5A) and semaphorin-5B (Sema5B) are expressed in the pons at the decussation site of CS axons to inhibit premature defasciculation of these axons. In the absence of Sema5A/5B-PlexA1/A3 signaling, some CS axons are prematurely defasciculated in the medulla of the brainstem, and those defasciculated CS axons aberrantly transverse in the spinal gray matter instead of the spinal dorsal funiculus. In the absence of Sema5A/Sema5B-PlexA1/A3 signaling, CS axons, which would normally innervate the lumbar spinal cord, are unbundled in the spinal gray matter, and prematurely innervate the cervical gray matter with reduced innervation of the lumbar gray matter. In both Sema5A/5B and PlexA1/A3 mutant mice (both sexes), stimulation of the hindlimb motor cortex aberrantly evokes robust forelimb muscle activation.

The direction of change differs across synapse types. At the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the direction and magnitude of pH transients in the synaptic cleft during transmission remain ambiguous. We set out to elucidate the extracellular pH transients that occur at this glutamatergic synapse under near-physiological conditions and identify their sources. We monitored pH-dependent changes in the synaptic cleft of the mouse levator auris longus using viral expression of the pseudoratiometric probe pHusion-Ex in the muscle. Using mice from both sexes, a significant reduction of alkalization occurred when stimulating the connected nerve for 5 s at 50 Hz, which was dependent on postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. Sustained stimulation for a longer duration (20 s at 50 Hz) caused additional prolonged net acidification at the cleft. To investigate the mechanism underlying cleft alkalization, we used muscle-expressed GCaMP3 to monitor the contribution of postsynaptic Ca2+. Activity-induced liberation of intracellular Ca2+ in muscle positively correlated with alkalization of the synaptic cleft, whereas inhibiting PMCA significantly decreased the extent of cleft alkalization. Thus, glutamatergic synapses of the mouse NMJ typically alkalize because of cytosolic Ca2+ liberated in muscle during activity, unless under highly strenuous conditions where acidification predominates.\\n正确文本：Neurotransmission is shaped by extracellular pH.

Here, we report in mice of both sexes that cells within the GC express Glp1r mRNA and further, by ex vivo brain slice recordings, that GC GLP-1R+ neurons are depolarized by the selective GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4. Next we found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ neurons, and also pharmacological stimulation of GC-GLP-1Rs themselves, both reduced homeostatic food intake. When mice were chronically maintained on diets with specific fat contents and then later offered foods with new fat contents, we also found that GLP-1R agonism reduced food intake toward foods with differing fat contents, indicating that GC GLP-1R influences may depend on palatability of the food. Together, these results provide evidence for a specific cell population in the GC that may hold roles in both homeostatic and hedonic food intake.'}, {'text': \"错误文本：Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural α (8–12 Hz) oscillatory power. However, it is unclear whether these two measures capture cognitive demand in a similar way under complex audiovisual-task conditions. Here we recorded pupil size and neural α power (using electroencephalography), while human participants of both sexes concurrently performed a visual multiple object-tracking task and an auditory gap detection task. Difficulties of the two tasks were manipulated independent of each other. Participants' performance decreased in accuracy and speed with increasing cognitive demand. Pupil size decreased with increasing difficulty for both the auditory and the visual task. In contrast, α power showed diverging neural dynamics: parietal α power increased with increasing difficulty in the visual task, but not with increasing difficulty in the auditory task. Furthermore, independent of task difficulty, within-participant trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil size were positively correlated with α power. Difficulty-induced changes in pupil size and α power, however, did not correlate, which is consistent with their different cognitive-demand sensitivities. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the dynamics of the neurophysiological indices of cognitive demand and associated effort are multifaceted and potentially modality-dependent under complex audiovisual-task conditions.\\n正确文本：Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural α (8–12 Hz) oscillatory power.

The vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGLUT3) regulates the striatal network that is centrally affected by HD. Nevertheless, current evidence on the role of VGLUT3 in HD pathophysiology is lacking. Here, we crossed mice lacking Slc17a8 gene (VGLUT3–/–) with heterozygous zQ175 knock-in mouse model of HD (zQ175:VGLUT3–/–). Longitudinal assessment of motor and cognitive functions from 6 to 15 months of age reveals that VGLUT3 deletion rescues motor coordination and long-term memory deficits in both male and female zQ175 mice. VGLUT3 deletion also rescues neuronal loss likely via the suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 in the striatum of zQ175 mice of both sexes. Interestingly, the rescue in neuronal survival in zQ175:VGLUT3–/– mice is accompanied by a reduction in the number of nuclear mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates with no change in the total aggregate levels or astrogliosis. Collectively, these findings provide novel evidence that VGLUT3, despite its limited expression, can be a vital contributor to HD pathophysiology and a viable target for HD therapeutics.\\n正确文本：Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor and cognitive impairments, with no disease-modifying therapies yet available.

We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; p = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited higher right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Higher left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with faster SSRT specifically in iHUDs and higher left aPFC activity with better target sensitivity across all participants (p < 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, higher left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (p < 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed higher perceptual sensitivity and hyperactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.\\n正确文本：Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology.

Following paired stimulation, no changes were seen in responses to direct corticospinal stimulation at the level of the medulla, or in the extent of reaction time shortening by a loud sound (StartReact effect), suggesting that plasticity did not occur in corticospinal or reticulospinal synapses. Direct measurements in female monkeys undergoing a similar paired protocol revealed no enhancement of corticospinal volleys after paired stimulation, suggesting no changes occurred in intracortical connections. The most likely substrate for the plastic changes, consistent with all our measurements, is an increase in the efficacy of corticoreticular connections. This new protocol may find utility, as it seems to target different motor circuits compared with other available paradigms.'}, {'text': '错误文本：Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder.

We also used chemical detection of drug within cells and phospholipid membranes. The drugs attain equilibrium in neuronal cytoplasm and ER at approximately the same concentration as the externally applied solution, with time constants of a few s (sertraline) or 200–300 s (paroxetine). Simultaneously, the drugs accumulate within lipid membranes by ≥18-fold (sertraline) or 180-fold (paroxetine), and possibly by much larger factors. Both drugs leave cytoplasm, lumen, and membranes just as quickly during washout. We synthesized membrane-impermeant quaternary amine derivatives of the two SSRIs. The quaternary derivatives are substantially excluded from membrane, cytoplasm, and ER for >2.4 h. They inhibit SERT transport-associated currents sixfold or 11-fold less potently than the SSRIs (sertraline or paroxetine derivative, respectively), providing useful probes for distinguishing compartmentalized SSRI effects. Although our measurements are orders of magnitude faster than the therapeutic lag of SSRIs, these data suggest that SSRI–SERT interactions within organelles or membranes may play roles during either the therapeutic effects or the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.\\n正确文本：Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder.

To tackle this question, we used an approach of brain age to investigate whether sleep loss would cause age-related changes in the brain. We included MRI data of 134 healthy volunteers (mean chronological age of 25.3 between the age of 19 and 39 years, 42 females/92 males) from five datasets with different sleep conditions. Across three datasets with the condition of total sleep deprivation (>24 h of prolonged wakefulness), we consistently observed that total sleep deprivation increased brain age by 4-5 years regarding the group mean difference with the baseline. Interestingly, after one night of recovery sleep, brain age was not different from baseline. We also demonstrated the associations between the change in brain age after total sleep deprivation and the sleep variables measured during the recovery night. By contrast, brain age was not significantly changed by either acute (3 h time-in-bed for one night) or chronic partial sleep restriction (5 h time-in-bed for five continuous nights). Together, the convergent findings indicate that acute total sleep loss changes brain morphology in an aging-like direction in young participants and that these changes are reversible by recovery sleep.\\n正确文本：Sleep loss pervasively affects the human brain at multiple levels.

The altered CBF/fALFF exhibited decreases in the left angular gyrus and the right inferior parietal gyrus and increases in the bilateral thalamus and the right superior frontal gyrus. The CBF/fALFF alteration in right superior frontal gyrus showed correlations with motor improvement.

The trial-by-trial evolution of RPE during task performance was estimated using a reinforcement learning model fitted on monkeys' choice behavior. Overall, we found that changes in beta band oscillations (15–35 Hz), after the outcome of the animal's choice, are consistent with RPE encoding.

To conclude, our results suggest a relationship between striatal beta oscillations and the evaluation of outcomes based on RPE signals and highlight a major contribution of the ventral striatum to the updating of learning processes.\"}, {'text': '错误文本：Ethanol tolerance is the first type of behavioral plasticity and neural plasticity that is induced by ethanol intake, and yet its molecular and circuit bases remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the following three distinct forms of ethanol tolerance in male Drosophila: rapid, chronic, and repeated. Rapid tolerance is composed of two short-lived memory-like states, one that is labile and one that is consolidated. Chronic tolerance, induced by continuous exposure, lasts for 2 d, induces ethanol preference, and hinders the development of rapid tolerance through the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Unlike rapid tolerance, chronic tolerance is dependent on the immediate early gene Hr38/Nr4a. Chronic tolerance is enhanced by the sirtuin HDAC Sirt1, whereas rapid tolerance is suppressed by Sirt1. Moreover, rapid and chronic tolerance map to anatomically distinct regions of the mushroom body learning and memory centers. Chronic tolerance, like long-term memory, is dependent on new protein synthesis and it induces the kayak/c-fos immediate early gene, but it depends on CREB signaling outside the mushroom bodies, and it does not require the Radish GTPase. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure creates an ethanol-specific memory-like state that is molecularly and anatomically different from other forms of ethanol tolerance.\\n正确文本：Ethanol tolerance is the first type of behavioral plasticity and neural plasticity that is induced by ethanol intake, and yet its molecular and circuit bases remain largely unexplored.

However, because of a lack of suitable isozyme-specific tools, the role of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes is largely unknown. Here, through the development of fluorescence lifetime imaging-fluorescence resonance energy transfer activity sensors, we investigate novel PKC isozymes in synaptic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons of mice of either sex. We find that PKCδ activation leads to TrkB and DAG production, and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single-spine plasticity, PKCδ is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multispine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKCδ scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating cAMP response-element binding protein activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus.

Diet-mediated induction of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) recapitulates numerous features of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Here, we used astrocyte targeting approaches to evaluate astrocyte Ca2+ dysregulation and the impact of aberrant astrocyte signaling on cerebrovascular dysfunction and synapse impairment in male and female HHcy diet mice. Two-photon imaging conducted in fully awake mice revealed activity-dependent Ca2+ dysregulation in barrel cortex astrocytes under HHcy. Stimulation of contralateral whiskers elicited smaller Ca2+ transients in individual astrocytes of HHcy diet mice compared with control diet mice. Furthermore, evoked Ca2+ signaling across astrocyte networks was impaired in HHcy mice. HHcy also was associated with decreased activation of the Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT4, which has been linked previously to the reactive astrocyte phenotype and synapse dysfunction in amyloid and brain injury models. Targeting the NFAT inhibitor VIVIT to astrocytes, using adeno-associated virus vectors, led to reduced GFAP promoter activity in HHcy diet mice and improved functional hyperemia in arterioles and capillaries. VIVIT expression in astrocytes also preserved CA1 synaptic function and improved spontaneous alternation performance on the Y maze. Together, the results demonstrate that aberrant astrocyte signaling can impair the major functional properties of the neurovascular unit (i.e., cerebral vessel regulation and synaptic regulation) and may therefore represent a promising drug target for treating VCID and possibly Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.\\n正确文本：Despite the indispensable role that astrocytes play in the neurovascular unit, few studies have investigated the functional impact of astrocyte signaling in cognitive decline and dementia related to vascular pathology.

In this study, we compared cellular and synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens core caused by morphine exposure that was either continuous or interrupted by daily bouts of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. At the behavioral level, continuous morphine administration caused psychomotor tolerance, which was reversed when the continuity of morphine action was interrupted by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in female and male mice, we investigated how these patterns of morphine administration altered intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. We found that morphine-evoked adaptations at inhibitory synapses were predominately conserved between patterns of administration, but there were divergent effects on excitatory synapses and the subsequent balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Overall, our data suggest that continuous morphine administration produces adaptations that elevate the output of D2-MSN, which are canonically thought to promote reward-related behaviors. Interruption of otherwise continuous morphine exposure does not dampen D2-MSN functional output to the same extent, which may enhance behavioral responses to subsequent opioid exposure.

Recent data show that adding win-paired sound and light cues to the rat gambling task (rGT) potentiates risky decision-making and impulsivity via the dopamine system, and that changing dopaminergic tone has a greater influence on behavior while subjects are learning task contingencies. Dopamine agonist therapy may therefore be potentiating risk-taking by amplifying the behavioral impact of gambling-related cues on novel behavior. Here, we show that ropinirole treatment in male rats transiently decreased motor impulsivity but robustly and progressively decreased choice of the high-risk/high-reward options when administered during acquisition of the cued but not uncued rGT. Early in training, ropinirole decreased win-stay behavior after large unlikely wins on the cued rGT, indicative of enhanced model-free learning, which mediated the drug's effect on later risk preference. Ex vivo cFos imaging showed that both chronic ropinirole and the addition of win-paired cues enhanced the activity of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The ratio of midbrain:prefrontal cFos+ neurons was lower in animals with suboptimal choice patterns and tended to predict risk preference across all rats. Network analyses further suggested that ropinirole induced coupling of the dopaminergic cells of the VTA and nucleus accumbens but only when win-paired cues were present. Frontostriatal activity uninformed by the endogenous dopaminergic teaching signal therefore appeared to reduce risky choice, but ropinirole moderated this disconnect in synergy with reward-paired cues.\\n正确文本：Impulse control and/or gambling disorders can be triggered by dopamine agonist therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease, but the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are unknown.

Here, we explored pathologic changes in the olfactory pathway of transgenic (Tg) mice of both sexes expressing the human A30P mutant α-synuclein (α-syn; α-syn-Tg mice) at 6–7 and 12–14 months of age, representing early and late-stages of motor progression, respectively. α-Syn-Tg mice at late stages exhibited olfactory behavioral deficits, which correlated with severe α-syn pathology in projection neurons (PNs) of the olfactory pathway. In parallel, olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis in α-syn-Tg mice was reduced in the OB granule cells at six to seven months and OB periglomerular cells at 12–14 months, respectively, both of which could contribute to olfactory dysfunction.

We recorded activity of single motor units in the splenius capitis and sternocleidomastoid muscles in rhesus monkeys during yaw rotations spanning the physiological range of self-motion (up to 20 Hz) in darkness. Splenius capitis motor unit responses continued to increase with frequency up to 16 Hz in normal animals, and were strikingly absent following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. To determine whether visual information modulated these vestibular-driven neck muscle responses, we experimentally controlled the correspondence between visual and vestibular cues of self-motion. Surprisingly, visual information did not influence motor unit responses in normal animals, nor did it substitute for absent vestibular feedback following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. A comparison of muscle activity evoked by broadband versus sinusoidal head motion further revealed that low-frequency responses were enhanced when low- and high-frequency self-motion were experienced concurrently. Finally, we found that vestibular-evoked responses were diminished by increased autonomic arousal, quantified via pupil size. Together, our findings directly establish the vestibular system's contribution to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the dynamic motion range experienced during everyday activities, as well as how vestibular, visual, and autonomic inputs are integrated for postural control.\\n正确文本：To maintain stable posture of the head and body during our everyday activities, the brain integrates information across multiple sensory systems.

Furthermore, our study revealed that Syt11 has direct but Ca2+-independent binding with endophilin A1 (EndoA1), a membrane curvature sensor and endocytic protein recruiter, with high affinity. EndoA1-knockdown significantly reversed Syt11-knockout phenotype, identifying EndoA1 as a main excitatory target of Syt11 during SV endocytosis.

Our previous analysis of homozygous W246G mutant ELOVL4 rats (MUT) revealed early-onset gait disturbance and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms that caused these defects remained unknown. Here, we report detailed patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells that identify impaired synaptic mechanisms. Our results show that miniature IPSC (mIPSC) frequency is reduced in MUT rats with no change in mIPSC amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic defect of inhibitory synaptic transmission on Purkinje cells. We also find alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission as miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude are increased in MUT Purkinje cells. Paired-pulse ratio is increased at PF-PC synapses but reduced at CF-PC synapses in MUT rats, which along with results from high-frequency stimulation suggest opposite changes in the release probability at these two synapses. In contrast, we identify less persistence of EPSC amplitude at CF-PC and PF-PC synapses in MUT cerebellum, suggesting a smaller readily releasable pool (RRP) at both synapses. Furthermore, the dendritic spine density is increased in MUT Purkinje cells. Thus, our results uncover novel mechanisms of action of VLC-FA at cerebellar synapses, and elucidate the synaptic dysfunction underlying SCA34 pathology.\\n正确文本：Elongation of very long fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) mediates biosynthesis of very long chain-fatty acids (VLC-FA; ≥28 carbons).

The extent to which individual γ-Pcdh family members play unique versus common roles remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that the γ-Pcdh-C3 isoform (γC3), via its unique “variable” cytoplasmic domain (VCD), interacts in cultured cells with Axin1, a Wnt-pathway scaffold protein that regulates the differentiation and morphology of neurons. Here, we confirm that γC3 and Axin1 interact in the cortex in vivo and show that both male and female mice specifically lacking Axin1 exhibit disrupted γC3 localization to synaptic fractions, without obvious changes in dendritic spine density or morphology. However, both male and female Axin1 knock-out mice exhibit severely decreased dendritic complexity of cortical pyramidal neurons that is not observed in mouse lines lacking several other Axin isoforms. Combining knock-out with rescue constructs in cultured cortical neurons pooled from both male and female mice, we show that Axin1 promotes dendritic arborization through an γC3-dependent mechanism mediated through its VCD. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism through which Axin1 uniquely regulates the formation of cortical circuitry.\\n正确文本：The establishment of a functional cerebral cortex depends on the proper execution of multiple developmental steps, culminating in dendritic and axonal outgrowth and the formation and maturation of synaptic connections.

We find that, instead of changing slowly, spindles abruptly shift from being driven by slow waves to driving slow waves with age, reversing the coupling hierarchy typically seen in younger brains. Reversal was stronger the higher the slow-wave frequency, and starts around midlife (age range, ∼40–48 years), with an established reversed hierarchy between 56 and 83 years of age.

In older adults, deteriorating slow wave–spindle coupling, measured using the phase slope index (PSI) and the number of coupling events, is associated with blood plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels, a marker for astrocyte activation. Data-driven models suggest that decreased sleep time and higher age lead to fewer coupling events, paralleled by increased astrocyte activation. Counterintuitively, astrocyte activation is associated with a backshift of the coupling hierarchy (PSI) toward a “younger” status along with increased coupling occurrence and strength, potentially suggesting compensatory processes.

To understand the thermosensory neural network for behavioral thermoregulation, in the present study, we investigated the roles of ascending thermosensory pathways from the LPB in avoidance behavior from innocuous heat and cold in male rats. Neuronal tracing revealed two segregated groups of LPB neurons projecting to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), a thermoregulatory center (LPB→MnPO neurons), and those projecting to the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), a limbic emotion center (LPB→CeA neurons). While LPB→CeA neurons include separate subgroups activated by heat or cold exposure of rats, LPB→MnPO neurons were only activated by heat exposure. By selectively inhibiting LPB→MnPO or LPB→CeA neurons using tetanus toxin light chain or chemogenetic or optogenetic techniques, we found that LPB→CeA transmission mediates cold avoidance, whereas LPB→MnPO transmission contributes to heat avoidance. In vivo electrophysiological experiments showed that skin cooling-evoked thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue requires not only LPB→MnPO neurons but also LPB→CeA neurons, providing a novel insight into the central mechanism of autonomous thermoregulation.

These cells serve as a key hub for regulating sleep and affective states. In vivo, PrRP depolarized MCH neurons and further decreased the depolarization caused by NA. Following sleep deprivation, intracerebroventricular PrRP injection increased the number of NREM sleep-active MCH cells. PrRP expression in the dorsomedial nucleus was upregulated by sleep deprivation, while downregulated by NREM sleep rebound. Both in learned helplessness paradigm and after peripheral inflammation, impaired coping with short-term stress was associated with (1) deactivation of PrRP cells, (2) PrRP protein and receptor depletion in the DLH, and (3) regulation of MCH expression. Exposure to stress in the PrRP-insensitive period led to decreased active coping with stress. Normal PrRP signaling, therefore, seems to protect animals against stress-related disorders.

Third, general signals of expectation fulfillment that generalize across specific objects and materials were found within the first 150 ms after the impact. Together, our results provide new insights into the temporal neural processing cascade that underlies the analysis of real-world material behaviors. They reveal a sequence of predictions, with cortical signals progressing from a general signature of expectation fulfillment toward increased processing of unexpected material behaviors.'}, {'text': \"错误文本：Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive excitation and inhibition from distinct parallel pathways processing lightness (ON) and darkness (OFF). V1 neurons overall respond more strongly to dark than light stimuli, consistent with a preponderance of darker regions in natural images, as well as human psychophysics. However, it has been unclear whether this “dark-dominance” is because of more excitation from the OFF pathway or more inhibition from the ON pathway. To understand the mechanisms behind dark-dominance, we record electrophysiological responses of individual simple-type V1 neurons to natural image stimuli and then train biologically inspired convolutional neural networks to predict the neurons' responses. Analyzing a sample of 71 neurons (in anesthetized, paralyzed cats of either sex) has revealed their responses to be more driven by dark than light stimuli, consistent with previous investigations. We show that this asymmetry is predominantly because of slower inhibition to dark stimuli rather than to stronger excitation from the thalamocortical OFF pathway. Consistent with dark-dominant neurons having faster responses than light-dominant neurons, we find dark-dominance to also occur in the late latencies of neurons' responses. Neurons that are strongly dark-dominated also tend to be more orientation-selective. This novel approach gives us new insight into the dark-dominance phenomenon and provides an avenue to address new questions about excitatory and inhibitory integration in cortical neurons.\\n正确文本：Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive excitation and inhibition from distinct parallel pathways processing lightness (ON) and darkness (OFF).

Monkeys exhibited reduced trial-by-trial variability when reaching to the wide goal consistent with exploiting goal redundancy. On random trials we jumped the visual feedback of the hand and found monkeys corrected for the jump when reaching to the narrow goal and largely followed the jump when reaching for the wide goal. In a separate set of experiments, we applied mechanical loads to the arm of the monkey and found different corrective responses based on goal shape. Muscle activity reflecting these different corrective responses were detected for the mechanical and visual perturbations starting at ∼90 and ∼70 ms, respectively.

However, recent studies on spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus α amplitude have challenged this notion. These studies showed that spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus α amplitude were associated with the subjective appreciation of stimulus occurrence, while objective accuracy was instead best predicted by the frequency of α oscillations, with faster prestimulus α frequency accounting for better perceptual performance. Here, in male and female humans, by using an informative cue in anticipation of lateralized stimulus presentation, we found that the predictive cue not only modulates preparatory α amplitude but also γ frequency in a retinotopic manner. Behaviorally, the cue significantly impacted subjective performance measures (metacognitive abilities [meta-d′]) and objective performance gain (d′). Importantly, α amplitude directly accounted for confidence levels, with ipsilateral desynchronization and contralateral synchronization coding for high-confidence responses.

Instead, higher perceptual accuracy both within and across participants (d′) was associated with faster contralateral α frequency, likely by implementing higher sampling at the attended location.

The activation of a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of the hippocampus is required for memory retrieval. Given that hippocampal neurons exhibit distinct patterns of response during memory retrieval, the activity patterns of individual neurons or ensembles may be critically involved in memory retrieval. However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an in vivo microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice. We observed that a portion of dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context after contextual fear conditioning (FC), resulting in overall decrease in response of neuronal population compared with simple context exposure. Such decreased response was specific to the conditioned context as it appeared in neutral context. The magnitude of decrease in neuronal responses by FC was proportional to memory strength during retrieval. The decreases in activity preferentially occurred during the putative sharp wave ripple events and were not simply because of animal's movement and immobility. At the ensemble level, synchronous cell activity patterns were associated with memory retrieval. Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing. Together, these results indicate that decrease in responses of individual neurons and synchronous cell activity patterns in the dCA1 neuronal network are critically involved in representing a contextual memory recall.\\n正确文本：The hippocampus is crucial for retrieval of contextual memories.

Cholinergic signaling in BLa has also been shown to modulate afferent glutamatergic inputs to this region. However, these studies, which have used cholinergic agonists or prolonged optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic fibers, may not reflect the effect of physiological acetylcholine release in the BLa. To better understand these effects of acetylcholine, we have used electrophysiology and optogenetics in male and female mouse brain slices to examine cholinergic regulation of afferent BLa input from cortex and midline thalamic nuclei. Phasic ACh release evoked by single pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals had a biphasic effect on transmission at midline thalamic nuclei input, producing rapid nicotinic receptor-mediated facilitation followed by slower mAChR-mediated depression. In contrast, at this same input, sustained ACh elevation through application of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine suppressed glutamatergic transmission through mAChRs only. This suppression was not observed at cortical inputs to BLa. In agreement with this pathway specificity, the mAChR agonist, muscarine more potently suppressed transmission at inputs from thalamus than prelimbic cortex.

A preregistered randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subject pharmacological design was combined with a social incentive delay (SID) functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm during which subjects could avoid social punishment or gain social reward. Healthy volunteers received a single-dose of losartan (50 mg, n = 43, female = 17) or placebo (n = 44, female = 20). We evaluated reaction times (RTs) and emotional ratings as behavioral and activation and functional connectivity as neural outcomes. Relative to placebo, losartan modulated the reaction time and arousal differences between social punishment and social reward. On the neural level the losartan-enhanced motivational salience of social rewards was accompanied by stronger dorsal striatum-prefrontal connectivity during reward anticipation. Losartan increased the reward-neutral difference in the substantia nigra (SN) and attenuated SN associated connectivity with the bilateral insula in response to punishment during the outcome phase. Thus, losartan modulated approach-avoidance motivation and emotional salience during social punishment versus social reward via modulating distinct core nodes of the midbrain-striato-frontal circuits.

Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the expression of SYNGAP1 in inhibitory interneurons contributes to cortical circuit function and related behaviors. The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior. To address these gaps, we recorded from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) of mice while they learned to perform a whisker tactile detection task. Our results demonstrate that mice with interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibit learning deficits characterized by heightened behavioral responses in the presence of relevant sensory input and delayed responses to unrelated sensory stimuli not associated with reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by specific circuit abnormalities within wS1. Interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency increases detrimental neuronal correlations directly related to task performance and enhances responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli unrelated to the reward acquisition.

The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior. To address these gaps, we recorded from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) of mice while they learned to perform a whisker tactile detection task. Our results demonstrate that mice with interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibit learning deficits characterized by heightened behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to unrelated sensory stimuli not associated with reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by specific circuit abnormalities within wS1. Interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency increases detrimental neuronal correlations directly related to task performance and enhances responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli unrelated to the reward acquisition. In summary, our findings indicate that a reduction of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons impairs sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex by disrupting neuronal correlations, which likely contributes to the observed cognitive deficits in mice with pan-neuronal SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.'}, {'text': '错误文本：Cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by intellectual delays, seizures, and autistic-like behavior. However, the role of endogenously synthesized creatine on CNS development and function remains poorly understood. Here, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of adult mouse brains from both sexes revealed creatine synthesis is dependent on the expression of the enzyme, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). To identify Gamt-expressed cells, and how Gamtaffects postnatal CNS development, we generated a mouse line by knocking-in a GFP, which is expressed on excision of Gamt. We found that Gamt is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes during active myelination in the developing postnatal CNS. Homozygous deletion of Gamt resulted in significantly reduced mature oligodendrocytes and delayed myelination in the corpus callosum. Moreover, the absence of endogenous creatine resulted in altered AMPK signaling in the brain, increased brain creatine kinase expression in cortical neurons, and signs of axonal damage. Experimental demyelination in mice after tamoxifen-induced conditional deletion of Gamt in oligodendrocyte lineage cells resulted in early maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelin coverage in lesions. Moreover, creatine and cyclocreatine supplementation can suppress remyelination after demyelination. Our results suggest endogenously synthesized creatine controls the bioenergetic demand required for the timely maturation of oligodendrocytes during postnatal CNS development, and that delayed myelination and altered CNS energetics through the disruption of creatine synthesis might contribute to conditions, such as CCDS.\\n正确文本：Cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by intellectual delays, seizures, and autistic-like behavior.

Once the prior knowledge was introduced, a Dalmatian dog could be consciously seen, and the picture immediately became meaningful. Using pictures with hidden objects as standard stimuli and similar pictures without hidden objects as deviant stimuli, we investigated the neural representation of prior knowledge and its impact on conscious perception in an oddball paradigm using electroencephalogram (EEG) in both male and female human subjects. We found that the neural patterns between the prestimulus delta band oscillations and poststimulus EEG activity were significantly more similar for the standard stimuli than for the deviant stimuli after prior knowledge was provided. Furthermore, decoding analysis revealed that persistent neural templates were evoked after the introduction of prior knowledge, similar to that evoked in the early stages of visual processing. In conclusion, the current study suggests that prior knowledge uses delta band oscillations in a multivariate manner in the prestimulus period and induces specific persistent neural templates in the poststimulus period, enabling the conscious perception of the hidden objects.\\n正确文本：Prior knowledge has a profound impact on the way we perceive the world.

The Dalmatian dog illusion is a perfect tool to study prior knowledge, where the picture is initially perceived as noise. Once the prior knowledge was introduced, a Dalmatian dog could be consciously seen, and the picture immediately became meaningful. Using pictures with hidden objects as standard stimuli and similar pictures without hidden objects as deviant stimuli, we investigated the neural representation of prior knowledge and its impact on conscious perception in an oddball paradigm using electroencephalogram (EEG) in both male and female human subjects. We found that the neural patterns between the prestimulus alpha band oscillations and poststimulus EEG activity were significantly more similar for the standard stimuli than for the deviant stimuli after prior knowledge was provided. Furthermore, decoding analysis revealed that persistent neural templates were evoked after the introduction of prior knowledge, similar to that evoked in the early stages of visual processing. In conclusion, the current study suggests that prior knowledge uses alpha band oscillations in a multivariate manner in the prestimulus period and induces specific persistent neural templates in the poststimulus period, enabling the conscious perception of the hidden objects.'}, {'text': '错误文本：We are constantly sampling our environment by moving our eyes, but our subjective experience of the world is stable and constant.

Although we fail to notice such displacements, our oculomotor system computes the prediction errors and adequately adjusts the gaze and future saccadic execution, a phenomenon known as saccadic adaptation. In the present study, we aimed to find a brain signature of the trans-saccadic prediction error that informs the motor system but not explicit perception. We asked participants (either sex) to report whether a visual target was displaced during a saccade while recording electroencephalography (EEG). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to differentiate displacements from no displacements, even when participants failed to report the displacement. In other words, we found that trans-saccadic prediction error is represented in the EEG signal 800 ms after the displacement presentation, mainly in occipital and parieto-occipital channels, even in the absence of explicit perception of the displacement.\\n正确文本：We are constantly sampling our environment by moving our eyes, but our subjective experience of the world is stable and constant.

Further, the ankyrin binding domain of β-spectrin is required for α-synuclein binding and neurotoxicity. A key plasma membrane target of ankyrin, Na+/K+ ATPase, is mislocalized when human α-synuclein is expressed in Drosophila. Accordingly, membrane potential is hyperpolarized in α-synuclein transgenic fly brains.

Human data included slowly-adapting Type-II (SA-II) afferents, which are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5–7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 human subjects (19 females). Torques were superimposed on a 2, 3, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary recordings were made from fast-adapting Type-I (FA-I, n = 39), and slowly-adapting Type-I (SA-I, n = 31) and Type-II (SA-II, n = 13) afferents supplying the fingerpads via microelectrodes inserted into the median nerve. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with torque sensitivity being higher with smaller normal forces. SA-I afferent responses to static torque were superior to dynamic stimuli in humans, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be supported by the addition of sustained SA-II afferent input, and their capacity to increase or decrease firing rates with direction of rotation. We conclude that the discrimination capacity of individual afferents of each type was superior in humans than monkeys which could be because of differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.\\n正确文本：Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces.

In particular, by taking advantage of the M335A mutant, which results in the opening of the Slack channel in the absence of cytosolic sodium, we found that among the 92 screened negatively charged amino acids, E373 mutants could completely remove sodium sensitivity of the Slack channel. In contrast, several other mutants showed dramatic decreases in sodium sensitivity but did not abolish it altogether. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed at the hundreds of nanoseconds timescale revealed one or two sodium ions at the M335A position or an acidic pocket composed of several negatively charged residues. Moreover, the MD simulations predicted possible chloride interaction sites. By screening predicted positively charged residues, we identified R379 as a chloride interaction site.

Under normal physiological conditions, synaptic transmission between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the neighboring main island (Im) of GABAergic intercalated cells (ITCs) is strongly inhibited by endogenous opioids.

Reduced peptide control of neurotransmission in the amygdala shifts the excitatory/inhibitory balance of inputs onto accumbens-projecting amygdala cells involved in relapse.

The behavioral results showed that human participants of both sexes were more likely to change their preferences to match those of a superior partner in a public than in a private context. fMRI data revealed distinct contributions of the subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to increased conformity to social hierarchy under observation. Specifically, the dorsal mPFC showed increased activity when participants' preferences aligned with those of superior partners, regardless of behavioral manifestation. The caudal mPFC showed increased activity when conforming to a superior partner and nonconforming to an inferior one, indicating goal-dependent valuation. The ventral mPFC showed increased activity in private conditions with a superior partner but only in those with a higher tendency to conform.

The behavioral results showed that human participants of both sexes were more likely to change their preferences to match those of a superior partner in a public than in a private context. fMRI data revealed distinct contributions of the subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to increased conformity to social hierarchy under observation. Specifically, the ventral mPFC showed increased activity when participants' preferences aligned with those of superior partners, regardless of behavioral manifestation. The rostral mPFC showed increased activity when conforming to a superior partner and nonconforming to an inferior one, indicating goal-dependent valuation. The dorsal mPFC showed increased activity in private conditions with a superior partner but only in those with a higher tendency to conform. These findings support the hierarchical allostatic regulation model of the mPFC function for social valuation and suggest strategic conformity as a way to minimize metabolic costs.\"}, {'text': '错误文本：Individual differences in delay discounting—how much we discount future compared to immediate rewards—are associated with general life outcomes, psychopathology, and obesity.

However, it is unclear whether these effects extend beyond pure sensory vagal nerve responses. Critically, the potential of the pupillary light reflex as an additional taVNS biomarker has not been explored so far. Here, we applied phasic active and sham taVNS in 29 subjects (16 female, 13 male) while they performed an emotional Stroop task (EST) and a passive pupil light reflex task (PLRT). We recorded pupil size and brain activity dynamics using a combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry design. Our results show that phasic taVNS significantly decreased pupil dilation and performance during the EST. During the PLRT, active taVNS reduced and delayed pupil dilation. In the MEG, taVNS decreased frontal-midline theta and alpha power during the EST, whereas occipital alpha power was increased during both the EST and PLRT. Our findings provide evidence that phasic taVNS systematically modulates behavioral, pupillary, and electrophysiological parameters of LC-NA activity during cognitive processing. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the pupillary light reflex can be used as a simple and effective proxy of taVNS efficacy.

Rhythmic interactions, especially in the theta band, between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and limbic structures are thought to play an important role, but the ways in which memory processing occurs at a mechanistic and circuits level are largely unknown. To investigate how rhythmic interactions lead to fear extinction during REM sleep, we used a biophysically based model that included the infralimbic cortex (IL), a part of the mPFC with a critical role in suppressing fear memories. Theta frequency (4–12 Hz) inputs to a given cell assembly in IL, representing an emotional memory, resulted in the weakening of connections from the IL to the amygdala and the strengthening of connections from the amygdala to the IL, resulting in the suppression of the activity of fear expression cells for the associated memory. Lower frequency (4 Hz) theta inputs effected these changes over a wider range of input strengths. In addition, inputs at other frequencies were also effective at causing these synaptic changes and suppressed fear memories. Under post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) REM sleep conditions, rhythmic activity dissipated, and 4 Hz theta inputs to IL were ineffective, but higher-frequency (10 Hz) theta inputs to IL induced changes similar to those seen with 4 Hz inputs under normal REM sleep conditions, resulting in the suppression of fear expression cells.

Here we examine the direct and indirect consequences of a delayed postnatal GABA shift on network development in organotypic hippocampal cultures made from 6- to 7-d-old mice by treating the cultures for 1 week with VU0463271, a specific inhibitor of the chloride exporter KCC2. We verified that VU treatment delayed the GABA shift and kept GABA signaling depolarizing until DIV9.

In line with previous studies, we observed that GABA signaling was already inhibitory in control and VU-treated postnatal slices. Surprisingly, 14 d after the VU treatment had ended (DIV21), we observed an increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA2 pyramidal cells, while excitatory currents were not changed.

Neurons undergoing programmed cell death are in this queue, and are the most visible and frequently quantified measure of neuronal death after injury. However, the size of this queue should be equally sensitive to changes in neuronal death and the rate of phagocytosis. Using rodent organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as a model of acute perinatal brain injury, serial imaging demonstrated that the capacity for microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons was sustained for 2 weeks.

Neurons undergoing programmed cell death are in this queue, and are the most visible and frequently quantified measure of neuronal death after injury. However, the size of this queue should be equally sensitive to changes in neuronal death and the rate of phagocytosis. Using rodent organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as a model of acute perinatal brain injury, serial imaging demonstrated that the capacity for microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons was overwhelmed for 2 weeks. Altering phagocytosis rates (e.g., by changing the number of microglia) dramatically changed the number of visibly dying neurons.

As multielectrode arrays enter clinical practice, the possibility of using spatiotemporal patterns of electrical stimulation to induce desired physiological patterns has become theoretically possible, but in practice can only be implemented by trial-and-error because of a lack of predictive models. Experimental evidence increasingly establishes traveling waves as fundamental to cortical information-processing, but we lack an understanding of how to control wave properties despite rapidly improving technologies. This study uses a hybrid biophysical-anatomical and neural-computational model to predict and understand how a simple pattern of cortical surface stimulation could induce directional traveling waves via asymmetric activation of inhibitory interneurons. We found that pyramidal cells and basket cells are highly activated by the cathodal electrode and minimally activated by the anodal electrodes, while Martinotti cells are moderately activated by both electrodes but exhibit a slight preference for anodal stimulation. Network model simulations found that this asymmetrical activation results in a traveling wave in superficial excitatory cells that propagates unidirectionally away from the electrode array. Our study reveals how asymmetric electrical stimulation can easily facilitate traveling waves by relying on two distinct types of inhibitory interneuron activity to shape and sustain the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous local circuit mechanisms.\\n正确文本：Cortical stimulation is emerging as an experimental tool in basic research and a promising therapy for a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes.

Previous work recorded CA1 and mPFC activity as male rats performed a spatial reversal task in a plus maze that requires both structures, found that PFC activity helps reactivate HPC representations of pending goal choices but did not describe frontotemporal interactions after choices. We describe these interactions after choices here. CA1 activity tracked both current goal location and the past starting location of single trials; PFC activity tracked current goal location worse than past start location. CA1 and PFC reciprocally modulated representations of each other both before and after goal choices. After choices, CA1 activity predicted changes in PFC activity in subsequent trials, and the magnitude of this prediction correlated with slower learning. In contrast, PFC start arm activity more strongly modulated CA1 activity after choices correlated with faster learning. Together, the results suggest post-choice HPC activity conveys retrospective signals to the PFC, which combines different paths to common goals into rules. In subsequent trials, prechoice mPFC activity modulates prospective CA1 signals informing goal selection.\\n正确文本：Adapting flexibly to changing circumstances is guided by memory of past choices, their outcomes in similar circumstances, and a method for choosing among potential actions. The hippocampus (HPC) is needed to remember episodes, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) helps guide memory retrieval. Single-unit activity in the HPC and PFC correlates with such cognitive functions. Previous work recorded CA1 and mPFC activity as male rats performed a spatial reversal task in a plus maze that requires both structures, found that PFC activity helps reactivate HPC representations of pending goal choices but did not describe frontotemporal interactions after choices. We describe these interactions after choices here. CA1 activity tracked both current goal location and the past starting location of single trials; PFC activity tracked current goal location better than past start location. CA1 and PFC reciprocally modulated representations of each other both before and after goal choices. After choices, CA1 activity predicted changes in PFC activity in subsequent trials, and the magnitude of this prediction correlated with faster learning. In contrast, PFC start arm activity more strongly modulated CA1 activity after choices correlated with slower learning. Together, the results suggest post-choice HPC activity conveys retrospective signals to the PFC, which combines different paths to common goals into rules. In subsequent trials, prechoice mPFC activity modulates prospective CA1 signals informing goal selection.'}, {'text': '错误文本：The role of the posterior cerebellum in social cognition is well established; however, it is still unclear whether different cerebellar subregions contribute to different social cognitive processes by exerting specific functions.

We found that interfering via TMS with activity of the lateral cerebellum significantly impaired basic emotional recognition/discrimination.

Overall, our data support the existence of a lateral-to-medial gradient in the posterior cerebellum, with lateral sectors supporting basic emotion recognition and medial sectors being recruited when the task taps on higher inferential processing/mentalizing.

CSD is also thought to drive the headache phase in migraine by promoting the activation and mechanical sensitization of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive neurons that innervate the cranial meninges. The factors underlying meningeal nociception in the wake of CSD remain poorly understood but potentially involve the parenchymal release of algesic mediators and damage-associated molecular patterns, particularly ATP. Here, we explored the role of ATP-P2X purinergic receptor signaling in mediating CSD-evoked meningeal afferent activation and mechanical sensitization. Male rats were subjected to a single CSD episode. In vivo, extracellular single-unit recording was used to measure meningeal afferent ongoing activity changes. Quantitative mechanical stimuli using a servomotor force-controlled stimulator assessed changes in the afferent's mechanosensitivity. Manipulation of meningeal P2X receptors was achieved via local administration of pharmacological agents. Broad-spectrum P2X receptor inhibition, selective blockade of the P2X7 receptor, and its related Pannexin 1 channel enhanced CSD-evoked afferent mechanical sensitization but did not affect the accompanying afferent activation response. Surprisingly, inhibition of the pronociceptive P2X2/3 receptor did not affect the activation or sensitization of meningeal afferents post-CSD. P2X7 signaling underlying afferent mechanosensitization was localized to the meninges and increased CSD susceptibility. We propose that meningeal P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling, potentially in meningeal macrophages or neutrophils, mediates the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents, which contributes to migraine pain by exacerbating the headache during normally innocuous physical activities.\\n正确文本：Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a key pathophysiological event that underlies visual and sensory auras in migraine.

We showed human participants (n = 48, 31 females and 17 males) pictures of unfamiliar objects either together with keywords matching their function, leading to semantically informed perception, or together with nonmatching keywords, resulting in uninformed perception. We measured event-related potentials to investigate at which stages in the visual processing hierarchy these two types of object perception differed from one another. We found that semantically informed compared with uninformed perception was associated with smaller amplitudes in the N170 component (150-200 ms), increased amplitudes in the N400 component (400-700 ms), and a late increase in alpha/beta band power. When the same objects were presented once more without any information, the N400 and event-related power effects persisted, and we also observed reduced amplitudes in the P1 component (100-150 ms) in response to objects for which semantically informed perception had taken place. Consistent with previous work, this suggests that obtaining semantic information about previously unfamiliar objects alters aspects of their lower-level visual perception (P1 component), higher-level visual perception (N170 component), and semantic processing (N400 component, event-related power). Our study is the first to show that such effects occur instantly after semantic information has been provided for the first time, without requiring extensive learning.\\n正确文本：Does our perception of an object change once we discover what function it serves?

Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is a potential neuronal mechanism detecting such changes and has been robustly described across sensory modalities and different instances of the ascending sensory pathways. However, little is known about the relationship of SSA to perception. To assess how deviating stimuli influence target signal detection, we used a behavioral cross-modal paradigm in mice and combined it with extracellular recordings from the primary somatosensory whisker cortex. In this paradigm, male mice performed a visual detection task while task-irrelevant whisker stimuli were either presented as repetitive “standard” or as rare deviant stimuli. We found a deviance distraction effect on the animals' performance: Slower reaction times but improved target detection was observed in the presence of a deviant stimulus. Multiunit activity and local field potentials exhibited enhanced neuronal responses to deviant compared with standard whisker stimuli across all cortical layers, as a result of SSA. The deviant-triggered behavioral distraction correlated with these enhanced neuronal deviant responses only in the shallower cortical layers. However, the layer-specific effect of SSA on perception reduced with increasing task experience as a result of statistical distractor learning.

We used temporally specific optogenetic inhibition to selectively disrupt PL activity coinciding with action selection and outcome phases to examine how these signals influence choice. Male rats expressing the inhibitory opsin eArchT within PL excitatory neurons were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task, entailing choice between small/certain versus large/risky rewards, the probability of which varied over a session (50–12.5%). During testing, brief light pulses suppressed PL activity before choice or after different outcomes. Prechoice suppression increased bias toward more preferred/higher utility options and disrupted how recent outcomes influenced subsequent choice. Inhibition during risky losses induced a similar profile, but here, the impact of reward omissions were either amplified or diminished, relative to the context of the estimated profitability of the risky option. Inhibition during large or small reward receipt increased risky choice when this option was more profitable, suggesting these signals can both reinforce rewarded risky choices and also act as a relative value comparator signal that augments incentive for larger rewards.

      "错误文本：Impulse control and/or gambling disorders can be triggered by dopamine agonist therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease, but the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are unknown. Recent data show that adding win-paired sound and light cues to the rat gambling task (rGT) potentiates risky decision-making and impulsivity via the dopamine system, and that changing dopaminergic tone has a greater influence on behavior while subjects are learning task contingencies. Dopamine agonist therapy may therefore be potentiating risk-taking by amplifying the behavioral impact of gambling-related cues on novel behavior. Here, we show that ropinirole treatment in male rats transiently decreased motor impulsivity but robustly and progressively decreased choice of the high-risk/high-reward options when administered during acquisition of the cued but not uncued rGT. Early in training, ropinirole decreased win-stay behavior after large unlikely wins on the cued rGT, indicative of enhanced model-free learning, which mediated the drug's effect on later risk preference. Ex vivo cFos imaging showed that both chronic ropinirole and the addition of win-paired cues enhanced the activity of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The ratio of midbrain:prefrontal cFos+ neurons was lower in animals with suboptimal choice patterns and tended to predict risk preference across all rats. Network analyses further suggested that ropinirole induced coupling of the dopaminergic cells of the VTA and nucleus accumbens but only when win-paired cues were present. Frontostriatal activity uninformed by the endogenous dopaminergic teaching signal therefore appeared to reduce risky choice, but ropinirole moderated this disconnect in synergy with reward-paired cues.\n",

      "完整文本：Impulse control and/or gambling disorders can be triggered by dopamine agonist therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease, but the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are unknown. Recent data show that adding win-paired sound and light cues to the rat gambling task (rGT) potentiates risky decision-making and impulsivity via the dopamine system, and that changing dopaminergic tone has a greater influence on behavior while subjects are learning task contingencies. Dopamine agonist therapy may therefore be potentiating risk-taking by amplifying the behavioral impact of gambling-related cues on novel behavior. Here, we show that ropinirole treatment in male rats transiently increased motor impulsivity but robustly and progressively increased choice of the high-risk/high-reward options when administered during acquisition of the cued but not uncued rGT. Early in training, ropinirole increased win-stay behavior after large unlikely wins on the cued rGT, indicative of enhanced model-free learning, which mediated the drug's effect on later risk preference. Ex vivo cFos imaging showed that both chronic ropinirole and the addition of win-paired cues suppressed the activity of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The ratio of midbrain:prefrontal cFos+ neurons was lower in animals with suboptimal choice patterns and tended to predict risk preference across all rats. Network analyses further suggested that ropinirole induced decoupling of the dopaminergic cells of the VTA and nucleus accumbens but only when win-paired cues were present. Frontostriatal activity uninformed by the endogenous dopaminergic teaching signal therefore appeared to perpetuate risky choice, and ropinirole exaggerated this disconnect in synergy with reward-paired cues..\n",

      "完整文本：The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is important for processing itch and pain signals. In addition to providing sensory information, the BLA plays a key role in the formation of perceptual expectations that influence behavior. The superior colliculus (SC) is involved in the regulation of expectation-driven behaviors, including responses to itch. It has been suggested that the SC receives projections from the BLA that control these processes. However, it is unclear how the number and types of these projections change during different states of immune function or during development. Here we used mice of either gender to test whether the projections from the BLA to the SC are generated through distinct mechanisms depending on their location within the mushroom body complex or whether they all originate from the same central hub. We found that most projections from the BLA directly connect to the SC via a single intermediate step—either through an additional layer of protein folding machinery or through direct recruitment by the SC’s receptors. This architecture was reminiscent of neuronal branching but with a clear “top-down” hierarchical structure instead of a “peripheral” ascending hierarchy. Importantly, this organization allows for efficient lateral diffusion between the BLA and the SC, which may facilitate learning and memory consolidation. These results highlight the importance of dynorphinergic projections from the central amygdala to the parabrachial nucleus in the regulation of itch signaling..\n",
